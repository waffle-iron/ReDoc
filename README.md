:rocket: :construction: Project in construction :construction::rocket:

The goal of this project is to generate automatically a showcase of components
contained in a project. Originally designed to work with React.js, it will aim all 
component based libraries such as Vue.js, Angular 2, Polymer or Aurelia.
 
To generate its documentation, it uses the input attributes defined on each component (like the PropTypes in React for example).
It could handle too the TypeScript and Flow typing, and JSDoc to give more information on usage of the components.

Why this project ?
------------------

When you work on a project using a component library often you feel the need to have a complete dictionary of component
because you wondering if that you are developing is not already built somewhere by someone else. And even more when you are a new joiner !

An other reason is to raise awareness the developers of importance of correctly document the inputs of theirs components.

In last, you have sometimes your own component library that we would like shared with a nice showcase easily to others developers or
on UX Designer ;)
